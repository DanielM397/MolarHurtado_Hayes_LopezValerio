Dataset Used For First Part/Development:
-CIFAR-10: Collection of 60k colored images (32x32 parameters) that fall under the following categories: Airplanes, Automobiles, Birds, Cats, Deer, Dogs, Frogs, Horses, Ships, and Trucks.

Option_4_Num_1: Learning, developing, and testing of the Image Recognition software using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Split into 12 separate codes (time of completion for some of these codes are lengthy in time, i.e. hours). The final predictor model labeled 'Final.h5' will be generated from here and will need to be carried on to the folders 'Option_4_Num_2' and 'Option_4_Num_3_And_4'.  

Option_4_Num_2: Reshaping of our own chosen images (2 of each of the mentioned categories) to be that of the parameters used in number one (32x32). Printing and saving both original and reshaped/converted images to both 'Option_4_Num_2' AND 'Option_4_Num_3_And_4' folders!

Option_4_Num_3_And_4: Reshaped images and predictor model will need to be within this folder to generate both the accuracy statistics of the model that will then make a prediction on what the picture is supposed to represent. Based on the user input, the converted images (32x32) will be used to predict.

The outcomes of each of the consoles for all parts of this project have been added to the folder for each section for the case of saving time or reviewing/observing what the final results came out to be.
